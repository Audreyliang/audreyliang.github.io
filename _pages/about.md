 <center>My name is Liang Huixiu, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Information Science and Technology Management at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Building upon my previous academic achievements, I hold a Master's degree in Applied Economics and have authored multiple research papers. However, I am driven by a desire to go beyond the realm of theory. My true passion lies in delving into the forefront of technological advancements and leveraging them to gain a novel perspective on economic phenomena. 

Throughout my academic journey, I have embraced the motto of "fall down and rise again," understanding the importance of resilience and constant growth. I approach each opportunity with a meticulous and dedicated mindset, committed to making the most of every step in my educational and professional endeavors.</center>
